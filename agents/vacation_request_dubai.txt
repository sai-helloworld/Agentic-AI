Subject: Request for Vacation – Dubai

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to formally request a vacation from [start date] to [end date]. I would like to spend this time in Dubai to recharge and experience a different culture, which I believe will help me return to work with renewed energy and creativity.

I have taken the following steps to ensure a smooth transition during my absence:

1. **Work Handover** – I will prepare a detailed handover document and brief my teammates on ongoing projects. 
2. **Availability** – I will remain reachable via email for any urgent matters and will respond within a reasonable timeframe. 
3. **Deadline Alignment** – I will complete all critical tasks before my departure and set up automated reminders for any deadlines that fall during my leave.

I understand that this is a busy period, and I will make sure that my responsibilities are covered. I am happy to discuss any concerns you might have regarding this request.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your approval.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
